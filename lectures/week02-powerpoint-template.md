## Slide 3: What is Design Thinking?
**Title:** What is Design Thinking? | デザイン思考とは？

**Definition:**
Design Thinking is a human-centered approach to innovation that draws from the designer's toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success.

デザイン思考は、人々のニーズ、技術の可能性、ビジネス成功の要件を統合するために、デザイナーのツールキットから引き出される人間中心のイノベーションアプローチです。

**Core Philosophy:**
- Human-Centered | 人間中心: Start with people, not technology
- Problem-Focused | 問題中心: Solve real problems, not symptoms
- Iterative | 反復的: Build, test, learn, repeat
- Collaborative | 協力的: Diverse perspectives create better solutions

**Why Design Thinking Matters:**
- Innovation | イノベーション: Creates breakthrough solutions
- User Satisfaction | ユーザー満足: Designs that people actually want to use
- Business Value | ビジネス価値: Solutions that work in the real world
- Learning | 学習: Teaches systematic problem-solving

**Visual Elements:**

- User Research: Interviews, observations, surveys
- Empathy Mapping: What users say, think, do, feel
- Context Understanding: When, where, why they use products

**2. Define | 定義**
- Goal: Articulate the problem clearly | 問題を明確に表現する
- Problem Statement: User-focused, specific, actionable
- Point of View (POV): [User] needs [need] because [insight]
- Success Criteria: How will we know we solved it?

**3. Ideate | 発想**
- Goal: Generate many creative solutions | 多くの創造的なソリューションを生成する
- Brainstorming: Quantity over quality initially
- Divergent Thinking: Explore many possibilities
- Creative Techniques: Analogies, "what if" scenarios

**4. Prototype | 試作**
- Goal: Build to think and test ideas | 考え、アイデアをテストするために構築する

- Discover Hidden Needs | 隠れたニーズを発見: Users often can't articulate what they want
- Build Better Solutions | より良いソリューションを構築: Understanding leads to innovation

**Empathy Techniques:**

**User Interviews | ユーザーインタビュー**
- Open-Ended Questions: "Tell me about..."
- Follow-Up Questions: "Why?" "Can you give me an example?"
- Context Questions: "When do you use this?" "What's happening around you?"

**Observation | 観察**
- Watch Actions: What they do vs. what they say
- Note Emotions: Frustration, confusion, delight
- Context Awareness: Environment, time, other people

```
[User type] needs [need/goal]
because [insight from research]
but currently [current problem/limitation]
```

**Example:**
```
Students registering for courses need to quickly see
which classes fit their schedule because they have
limited time during registration windows, but
currently they must check each course individually
across multiple pages.
```

**Characteristics of Good Problem Statements:**
- User-Focused | ユーザー中心: About people, not technology
- Specific | 具体的: Clear and actionable
- Insight-Based | 洞察ベース: Based on real research, not assumptions
- Problem-Oriented | 問題指向: Describes the problem, not the solution

**"How Might We" Questions:**
Transform problems into opportunities for ideation:
- How might we make course schedule conflicts immediately visible?
- How might we help students find courses that match their interests?
- How might we reduce the time needed for course registration?
