## Slide 15: Using Personas in Design Decisions
**Title:** Using Personas in Design Decisions | デザイン決定でペルソナを使用

**The "Persona Check":**

When making design decisions, ask:
- "Would Sarah use this feature?"
  - If no, why are we building it?
- "How would Sarah discover this?"
  - Is it obvious or hidden?
- "Can Sarah do this on mobile during lunch?"
  - Mobile context matters
- "Does this solve Sarah's pain points?"
  - Focus on real problems

**Avoiding Anti-Patterns:**

**Don't:**
- Design for yourself
- Add features "because it's cool"
- Ignore persona constraints
- Create features that don't match persona goals

**Do:**
- Reference personas in every design review
- Test scenarios against wireframes
