## Slide 3: Why User Research Matters
**Title:** Why User Research Matters | なぜユーザー調査が重要なのか

**The Foundation of Good Design:**
User research is NOT optional - it's the foundation of user-centered design.

**What Happens Without Research:**
- Assumptions replace facts | 仮定が事実に置き換わる: Designers guess what users want
- Solutions don't match problems | ソリューションが問題と一致しない: Building the wrong thing
- Resources wasted | リソースの浪費: Time and money on features nobody uses
- User frustration | ユーザーのフラストレーション: Interfaces that don't work for real people

**What Research Provides:**
- Evidence-based decisions | 証拠に基づく決定: Data-driven design choices
- Deep user understanding | 深いユーザー理解: Know your users' real needs
- Problem validation | 問題検証: Confirm you're solving real problems
- Hidden insights | 隠された洞察: Discover needs users can't articulate

**Real-World Impact:**
Example: Airbnb struggled until they researched why bookings were low. They discovered poor-quality photos hurt trust. Solution: Professional photography service. Result: 2.5x booking increase.

**Visual Elements:**
- Impact statistics
- Before/after case study visuals
- Research benefits icons

## Slide 4: Types of User Research
**Title:** Types of User Research | ユーザー調査のタイプ

**Research Dimensions:**

**1. Qualitative vs. Quantitative:**

**Qualitative Research | 質的調査**
- What it is: Understanding why and how
- Methods: Interviews, observations, think-aloud
- Data: Words, behaviors, emotions, stories
- Question: "Why do students find course registration frustrating?"
- When: Early research, understanding context

**Quantitative Research | 量的調査**
- What it is: Measuring what and how many
- Methods: Surveys, analytics, A/B testing
- Data: Numbers, statistics, measurements
- Question: "How many students abandon registration midway?"
- When: Validating designs, measuring impact

**2. Attitudinal vs. Behavioral:**

**Attitudinal (What people say) | 態度的（人々が言うこと）**
- Surveys, interviews, focus groups
- Opinions, preferences, intentions
- "I want a faster interface"

**Behavioral (What people do) | 行動的（人々がすること）**
- Observations, usage data, eye tracking
- Actions, patterns, actual behavior
- [Clicks on slow-loading feature repeatedly]

**Key Insight:** What people say ≠ What people do

**Closed Questions (Avoid in interviews) | クローズド質問（インタビューで避ける）**
- "Do you like the current registration system?" → Yes/No
- "Is it fast or slow?" → One-word answer
- "Would you use a mobile app?" → Hypothetical, unreliable

**Open-Ended Questions (Use these!) | オープンエンド質問（これらを使用！）**
- "Tell me about your last experience registering for courses" → Story
- "Walk me through how you choose which courses to take" → Process
- "What's the most frustrating part of registration?" → Pain points

**Question Types and When to Use Them:**

**Behavior Questions | 行動質問**
- Focus on what people actually do
- "How do you currently..."
- "Can you show me..."
- "What happened the last time..."

**Context Questions | コンテキスト質問**

- Don't interrupt

**2. Let Silence Work | 沈黙を機能させる**
- Don't fear silence: People need time to think
- Count to 5: Wait before filling silence
- Often leads to deeper insights: User adds important details

**3. Reflect and Paraphrase | 反映し言い換える**
- "So what you're saying is..."
- "It sounds like you feel..."
- Purpose: Confirm understanding, show you're listening

**4. Watch Body Language | ボディランゲージを見る**

## Slide 9: Observation Methods
**Title:** Observation Methods | 観察方法

**Learning by Watching:**
"What people do" often differs from "what people say"

**Types of Observation:**

**Direct Observation | 直接観察**
- Watch users in their natural environment
- Don't interfere or help
- Note what they do, not what they say
- Example: Observe students registering for courses in computer lab

**Contextual Inquiry | コンテクスチュアルインクワイアリー**
- Combination of observation + interview
- Watch them work, ask questions during process
- "Can you show me how you normally do this?"
- Best for understanding workflows

**Think-Aloud Protocol | シンクアラウドプロトコル**
- Users verbalize thoughts while performing tasks
- "Please say out loud what you're thinking"
- Reveals mental models and confusion points
- Great for usability testing

**What to Observe:**
- Actions: What do they click, type, scroll?
- Workarounds: What hacks have they developed?
- Errors: Where do they make mistakes?
- Hesitations: Where do they pause or look confused?
- Environment: Noise, interruptions, multi-tasking
- Tools: What else are they using simultaneously?

**Visual Elements:**
- Observation session photos
- What to observe checklist

- Validating assumptions with numbers
- Reaching distributed users
- Measuring trends over time

**Surveys are BAD for:**
- Understanding "why"
- Initial exploration
- Discovering unknown problems
- Deep insights
- Observing behavior

**Survey Design Best Practices:**

**Keep It Short | 短く保つ**
- 5-10 minutes maximum
- 10-15 questions
- Longer = higher abandonment

**Question Types | 質問タイプ**
- Multiple choice: Easy to analyze
- Rating scales: "Rate 1-5" for quantification
- Open text: Use sparingly for details
- Avoid leading questions: "How much do you love...?" → Bias

**Clear Language | 明確な言語**
- Simple, unambiguous wording
- Avoid jargon
- One question at a time
- Test survey before distributing

**Visual Elements:**
- Survey best practices checklist
- Good vs. bad question examples
- Response rate tips

## Slide 11: Analyzing Qualitative Data
**Title:** Analyzing Qualitative Data | 質的データの分析

**From Raw Data to Insights:**
The research is only valuable if you analyze it properly

**Affinity Mapping Process:**
A powerful technique for organizing qualitative findings

**Step 1: Extract Insights | 洞察を抽出**
- Review all interview notes
- Write each significant finding on separate note
- Include direct quotes
- One insight per note

**Step 2: Group Similar Items | 類似のアイテムをグループ化**
- Look for patterns
- Cluster related insights together
- Move notes around physically or digitally
- Don't force groupings

**Step 3: Label Themes | テーマにラベルを付ける**
- Name each cluster descriptively
- What unites these insights?
- Examples: "Time pressure," "Mobile limitations," "Lack of information"

**Step 4: Prioritize | 優先順位付け**
- How many users mentioned this?
- How severe is the problem?
- Which themes matter most?

**Finding Patterns:**
- Frequency: Mentioned by 4/5 users → Important
- Emotional intensity: Strong frustration → High priority
- Surprises: Unexpected findings → Valuable insights
- Contradictions: Different user segments? Different contexts?

**Visual Elements:**
- Affinity mapping process diagram
- Example affinity map photo
- Pattern finding techniques

## Slide 12: Synthesizing User Needs
**Title:** Synthesizing User Needs | ユーザーニーズの統合

**From Findings to Actionable Needs:**
Transform research insights into clear user needs that guide design

**User Needs Statement Framework:**

**Template:**
```
[User type] needs to [goal/action]
in order to [desired outcome]
because [current challenge/context]
```

**Example:**
```
Students need to quickly check which courses still have open seats
in order to register before classes fill up
because the registration period is only 3 days and popular courses
close within hours.
```

**Characteristics of Good User Needs:**

**User-Focused | ユーザー中心**
- About users, not systems
- "Students need to see schedules" ✅
- "The system should display schedules" ❌

**Specific | 具体的**
- Clear and concrete
- "Students need better registration" ❌ Vague
- "Students need to compare course times with their part-time work schedule" ✅ Specific

**Evidence-Based | 証拠ベース**
- Supported by research data
- Include: "3/5 users mentioned..."
- Link to interview quotes

**Problem-Oriented, Not Solution-Oriented | 問題指向、ソリューション指向ではない**
- Describe the need, not how to solve it
- "Students need a search function" ❌ Solution
- "Students need to quickly find courses matching requirements" ✅ Need

**Visual Elements:**
- User needs statement template
- Good vs. bad examples
- Evidence linking diagram

- Creates bias, gets unreliable data
- Better: "How do you feel about the interface?"

**Mistake 2: Asking About Future Behavior | 間違い2：将来の行動について尋ねる**
- Problem: "Would you use a mobile version?"
- Hypothetical → unreliable
- Better: "Tell me about times you've tried to register from your phone"

**Mistake 3: Talking Too Much | 間違い3：話しすぎる**
- Problem: Filling every silence, explaining your ideas
- Better: 80/20 rule - Participant talks 80%, you talk 20%

**Mistake 4: Asking Only What You Planned | 間違い4：計画したことだけを尋ねる**
- Problem: Rigidly following script, missing opportunities
- Better: Use guide flexibly, follow interesting threads

**Mistake 5: Assuming You Know Users | 間違い5：ユーザーを知っていると仮定する**
- Problem: "Students obviously want..."
- Better: Research with actual users, challenge assumptions

**Mistake 6: Small, Homogeneous Sample | 間違い6：小規模で均質なサンプル**
- Problem: Interviewing only friends or one user type
- Better: Recruit diverse participants representing different user segments
