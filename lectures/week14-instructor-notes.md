## Managing Presentations | プレゼンテーションの管理

### Presentation Flow

**Before Each Presentation:**
1. Announce next presenter
2. Give them 1-2 minutes to set up
3. Help with technical issues if needed
4. Distribute peer feedback forms
5. Start timer when ready

**During Presentation:**
1. Monitor time (give 2-minute and 1-minute warnings)
2. Take notes on strengths to mention
3. Prepare thoughtful question if Q&A is slow
4. Watch audience engagement
5. Note any technical issues

**After Presentation:**
1. Lead applause
2. Facilitate Q&A (2-3 minutes)
3. Ask your own question if needed
4. Give 2 minutes for peer feedback completion
5. Thank presenter
6. Transition to next presenter

### Time Management Strategies

**If Running Over:**
- Politely interrupt with time warnings
- "That's our 10-minute mark, please wrap up"
- Allow to finish thought but keep brief
- Adjust Q&A time if needed

**If Running Short:**
- Extended Q&A
- Ask follow-up questions
- Encourage deeper discussion
- Extra feedback time

**If Technical Issues:**
- Stay calm and supportive
- "Let's take a minute to troubleshoot"
- Have backup options ready
- Don't count setup time against presentation

---

## Question and Answer Facilitation | Q&Aファシリテーション

### Encouraging Good Questions

**Model Good Questions:**
- "Can you explain why you chose that color scheme?"
- "How did user feedback influence that design decision?"
- "What accessibility features did you include?"
- "If you had more time, what would you add?"

**If No Questions:**
- Ask your prepared question
- "I'm curious about..."
- "I noticed... can you tell us more?"
- Highlight something impressive and ask about it

**If Inappropriate Questions:**
- Redirect diplomatically
- "Let's focus on the design decisions"
- "That's more about personal preference than design principles"
- Protect presenters from harsh criticism

## Bot-Conducted Final Assessment | ボット実施最終評価

### Purpose and Process

**What is the Bot Assessment?**
The HCI-101 Bot conducts a conversational interview with each student about their design decisions, testing their understanding of HCI principles and ability to justify design choices.

**HCI-101ボットは何ですか？**
HCI-101ボットは、各学生のデザイン決定について会話形式のインタビューを実施し、HCI原則の理解とデザイン選択を正当化する能力をテストします。

**Assessment Topics:**
1. User research methodology and findings
2. Design thinking process application
3. Usability principles and heuristics
4. Accessibility standards and implementation
5. Design iteration rationale
6. Technical decision justification

**Scheduling:**
- 15-20 minutes per student
- Can be done after all presentations
- Or scheduled separately outside class time
- Students access via bot portal
- No outside AI assistance allowed during assessment

**Grading:**
- Part of final project grade (15 points from bot assessments)
- Evaluates depth of understanding
- Ability to articulate design rationale
- Application of HCI principles
- Critical thinking about own work
