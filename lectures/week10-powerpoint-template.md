## Slide 3: What is Usability Testing?
**Title:** What is Usability Testing? | ユーザビリティテストとは？

**Definition Box:**
Usability Testing is the process of evaluating a product or interface by testing it with representative users to identify usability problems, gather data, and determine user satisfaction.

**Why Test? (Four Reasons):**
1. ✓ Validate Design Decisions
2. ✓ Identify Issues Early
3. ✓ Improve User Experience
4. ✓ Reduce Development Costs

**Key Principle (Emphasized):**
**YOU ARE NOT THE USER!**
Designers' assumptions ≠ Real user behavior

**Visual Elements:**
- User testing imagery
- Before/after comparison
- Lightbulb icon for "Key Principle"

## Slide 4: Types of Usability Testing
**Title:** Types of Usability Testing | ユーザビリティテストの種類

**Two-Column Layout:**

**Moderated Testing | 司会付きテスト**
- In-Person Moderated
  - Pros: Rich insights, deep probing
  - Cons: Time-consuming, limited participants
  - Best For: Early prototypes, complex interfaces

- Remote Moderated
  - Pros: Wider participant pool, natural environment
  - Cons: Technical issues, harder to observe
  - Best For: Distributed teams, mobile testing

**Unmoderated Testing | 司会なしテスト**
- Remote Unmoderated
  - Pros: Fast, scalable, lower cost
  - Cons: No probing, can't clarify confusion
  - Best For: Large samples, quantitative metrics

**Visual Elements:**
- Icons for each testing type
- Comparison table
- Video call imagery for remote

## Slide 5: Choosing the Right Method
**Title:** Choosing the Right Testing Method | 適切なテスト方法の選択

**Decision Framework:**

**Use Moderated When:**
- Deep qualitative insights needed
- Testing early prototypes
- Complex tasks requiring guidance
- 5-8 participants sufficient
- Budget allows researcher time

**Use Unmoderated When:**
- Quantitative metrics at scale
- Simple, well-defined tasks
- Geographically dispersed participants
- Large sample needed (20+ users)
- Limited time and budget

**Highlighted Box:**
**Nielsen's Rule: 5 Users = 85% of Problems**

**Visual Elements:**

✅ Independent (each task stands alone)

**Examples:**

**Good Task:**
"You want to track your morning run. Start a running session and record 30 minutes of activity."

**Bad Task #1 (Too Vague):**
"Use the app to do something with running."

**Bad Task #2 (Leading):**
"Click the green 'Start Run' button to begin tracking."

**Visual Elements:**
- Green checkmarks for good examples
- Red X marks for bad examples
- Side-by-side comparison

## Slide 8: Think-Aloud Protocol
**Title:** The Think-Aloud Protocol | シンクアラウドプロトコル

Users verbalize their thoughts, feelings, and actions while using an interface.

**Benefits:**
- Reveals mental models
- Identifies confusion points
- Exposes mismatched expectations
- Provides rich qualitative data

**Instructions for Participants:**
"Please think out loud as you complete the tasks. Tell me what you're looking for, what you're thinking, and what you're trying to do."

**Moderator Prompts:**
- "What are you thinking?"
- "What do you expect to happen?"
- "Why did you choose that option?"

**⚠️ Avoid Leading Questions!**

**Visual Elements:**
- Speech bubble graphics
- Person thinking illustration
- Do's and Don'ts list

  - 60-69 = Fair
  - <60 = Needs Improvement

**Sample SUS Questions:**
1. I would like to use this system frequently
2. I found the system unnecessarily complex
3. I thought the system was easy to use
