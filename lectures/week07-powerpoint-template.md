## Slide 4: What is an Interactive Prototype?
**Title:** What is an Interactive Prototype? | インタラクティブプロトタイプとは？

**Definition:**
An interactive prototype is a clickable simulation of your app that demonstrates how users navigate between screens and interact with elements.

**Key Characteristics:**
- 🖱️ Clickable: Buttons and UI elements respond to taps/clicks
- 🔄 Navigation: Users can move between screens
- ✨ Transitions: Screens animate in and out
- 🧪 Testable: Can be used in usability testing

**Why Create Interactive Prototypes?**
- Validate User Flows
- Test with Users
- Communicate Intent
- Refine Interactions

**Visual Elements:**
- Interactive prototype screenshot
- Click indicators
- Flow diagram
- Testing imagery

## Slide 5: Understanding User Flows
**Title:** Understanding User Flows | ユーザーフローの理解

**What is a User Flow?**
A user flow is the path a user takes through your app to complete a specific task.

**Components:**
1. Entry Point: Where does the user start?
2. Actions: What does the user do?
3. Decision Points: What choices does the user make?
4. Exit Point: Where does the flow end?

**Common User Flows:**
- Onboarding: Welcome → Login → Tutorial → Home
- Search: Home → Search → Results → Detail
- Purchase: Browse → Cart → Checkout → Confirmation
- Settings: Profile → Settings → Edit → Save

**Visual Elements:**
- User flow diagram examples
- Flowchart showing decision points
- Real app flow examples

## Slide 8: Micro-Interactions
**Title:** Micro-Interactions and Feedback | マイクロインタラクションとフィードバック

**What are Micro-Interactions?**
Small, subtle animations that provide feedback when users interact with elements

**Types:**

**Button States:**
- Hover: Color change, slight scale
- Press: Depth effect, color darkening
- Disabled: Grayed out, no interaction

**Loading States:**
- Spinners: Circular loading indicators
- Progress bars: Show completion percentage
- Skeleton screens: Content placeholder animation

**Success/Error Feedback:**
- Checkmarks: Green confirmation
- Error icons: Red warning symbols
- Toast notifications: Brief bottom messages

**Visual Elements:**

## Slide 9: Designing Effective Navigation
**Title:** Designing Effective Navigation | 効果的なナビゲーションのデザイン

**Four Key Principles:**

**1. Clarity**
- Users always know where they are
- Show current location in navigation
- Use clear page titles and headings

**2. Consistency**
- Navigation elements in same place
- Tab bars always at bottom
- Back buttons always top-left

**3. Efficiency**
- Minimize taps to reach content
- Aim for 3 taps or less to any screen
- Provide shortcuts for frequent tasks

**4. Forgiveness**
- Allow users to go back
- Always provide back button or gesture
- Don't trap users in flows

**Visual Elements:**
- Navigation examples (good vs bad)
- Efficiency diagram
- User path visualization

- Why: Overwhelming, hard to maintain

**2. Inconsistent Transitions**
- Problem: Random animations for similar actions
- Solution: Use same transition for same action type
- Why: Creates confusion

**3. Missing Back Navigation**
- Problem: No way to return to previous screen
- Solution: Always include back button
- Why: Users get trapped

**4. Over-Animation**
- Problem: Too many fancy transitions
- Solution: Keep animations subtle
- Why: Slows down interaction

**5. Not Testing**
